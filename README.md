# SQL_Portfolio_Project

## Covid-19 Data Exploration on SQL

This project serves as a testament to my expertise in SQL data manipulation and exploration techniques, showcasing proficiency in Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. Leveraging Covid-19 datasets sourced from `coviddeaths.xlsx` and `covidvaccinations.xlsx`, this project delves into critical analyses of the pandemic's impact.

##Project Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project were to:

- Analyze Covid-19 Data: Utilize SQL queries to delve into various aspects of Covid-19 data, extracting meaningful insights to better understand the pandemic's dynamics.

- Run Diverse Queries: Execute a series of SQL queries to perform multifaceted analyses, including:

- Total Cases vs Total Deaths: Examining the likelihood of mortality if an individual contracts Covid-19 within a specific country.
- Total Cases vs Population: Highlighting the percentage of the population infected with Covid-19.
- Countries with Highest Infection Rate: Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population: Analyzing countries with the highest death counts per population, followed by a breakdown by continent.
- Breaking Things Down by Continent: Investigating continents with the highest death counts per population.
- Global Numbers: Aggregating global Covid-19 statistics.
- Total Population vs Vaccinations: Exploring the percentage of the population that has received at least one Covid vaccine.
- Using CTEs and Temp Tables: Applying Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Temporary Tables to perform calculations and partition data in previous queries.

## Repository Contents:

- **SQL Queries**: Contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts showcasing various data exploration techniques.
- **Excel Files**: Raw datasets (`coviddeaths.xlsx` and `covidvaccinations.xlsx`) utilized for analysis.
- **README**: This file provides an overview of project objectives, methodologies, and key findings.

## Usage:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Import the Covid-19 datasets into your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Execute the SQL scripts to conduct data exploration and analysis.
4. Utilize insights obtained to generate informative visualizations, potentially using Excel or other data visualization tools.

## Key Highlights:

- Demonstrated proficiency in diverse SQL techniques, enabling comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 data.
- Produced insightful analyses, shedding light on critical aspects such as mortality rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress.
- Employed advanced SQL functionalities to perform complex calculations and derive meaningful conclusions.

## Future Enhancements:

- Explore additional datasets to enrich analysis and gain deeper insights into the Covid-19 pandemic.
- Implement advanced statistical analysis techniques to uncover more intricate patterns and trends in the data.
